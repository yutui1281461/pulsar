Pulsar {% popover clusters %} and {% popover brokers %} can be managed using Pulsar's [admin interface](../AdminInterface).

## Admin setup

## Managing clusters

{% include explanations/cluster-admin.md %}

In Pulsar, a {% popover cluster %} is a group of {% popover brokers %}, {% popover bookies %}, and other components. Pulsar {% popover instances %} are comprised of multiple Pulsar clusters that replicate to one another using {% popover geo-replication %}.

## Managing brokers

In Pulsar, a {% popover broker %} consists of two components: an HTTP server exposing a [REST interface](../../reference/RestApi) that powers both {% popover topic lookup %} and a {% popover dispatcher %}.
